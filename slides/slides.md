# Why ligthning talk? ⚡️

- It is a JavaScript conference, this topic is not so related to JS world, but I tried to put the maxium amount of programer content to it (dark slides).
- I can talk about this topic for hours, but short talks are more likely to keep the audience's attention from start to finish.
- Lightning talks are like a power workout, brief but impactful.
- I try to give you the most of the takeaways what I can

# Let's start with my favorite topic STRENGTH
> Studies shows that the average grip strength of **women** from the **1970s** is comparable to that of **teeneager boys today**.

So nowdays we are much weeker than earlier.

#### But why it is important? 💪
- It isn't just important for daily tasks (carry groceries, lift objects etc..).
- Strength helps you to live a better quality life. Everything became easier.
- It reduces the risk of injuries, by improving your balance and stability.
- More strength more muscle helping which help you in the weight management
- **Reduce mortality**.

*In the 2020 [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7877981/) shows the people with lower grip strength were more likely (20%) to die of any cause compared to people with higher grip strength.*
